# mcl

minecraft launcher for linux and maybe macos

## what does it do

- download many versions
- download assets
- download libraries
- set up natives
- select the correct libraries for the version
- get an authentication token (microsoft auth only)
- instances
- launch the game

## what does it *not* do

- optifine, forge, etc
- support external natives (openbsd, freebsd, etc)
- windows support. i will not be adding this

## why not use the regular launcher

- closed source
- really buggy for some reason
- i would call it bloated but honestly this is probably slower

## why not a third party launcher

theyre all too complex and weird and have Discourse
