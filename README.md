# mcl

Minecraft launcher created out of dissatisfaction with other clients

## What's it do?

- download many versions
- download assets
- download libraries

## What's it *not* do?

- select the correct libraries for the version
- set up natives (will only support linux)
- get an authentication token (I will not support Mojang accounts)
- instances
- ...launch the game :/

## Why not use the regular launcher?

- closed source
- really buggy, for some reason
- I'd call it bloated but honestly this is probably slower

## Why not a third party launcher?

GDLauncher sounds great but it crashes for me and MultiMC's management sucks; they're terrible about custom builds and branding. I don't know of any other launchers and quite frankly I think I should just torture myself by making one.

## I want to steal your code.

I'm honored, I guess? The code is public domain. There's no license file, so just put in your own and pretend I put it there.
